    "### Variables and Types\n",
    "All useful data is a collection of different types of data: letters, words, numbers, tables, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use variables to store data, each are given a type at assignment.  Variables have names, types, and data.  Python variables can be of type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary.  The types are important to understand and will impact coding operations, for instance we are required to use str() function in concatenation of different data types. A type of List allows developer to perform iteration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections.  Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection.  \n",
    "2. Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output."

    "- As we learned above, a List is a data type: class 'list'\n",
    "- A <mark>'list' data type has the method '.append(expression)'</mark> that allows you to add to the list.  A class usually has extra methods to support working with its objects.\n",
    "- In the example below,  the expression is appended to the 'list' is the data type: class 'dict'\n",
    "- At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.  This is a <mark>list of dictionaries</mark>, or a collection of many similar data patterns.  The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts.  Just believe it is easy ;) and it will become so."
