    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Picture this: You and your team have been assigned the exciting task of creating and deploying a full-stack application with multiple creative features. It’s easy to procrastinate on such a seemingly daunting project, especially when diving into unfamiliar frameworks and technologies feels overwhelming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where planning comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the development of a web application, ideation is a crucial step where you conceptualize and plan the features and functionality of your project. For this tutorial, we'll walk through the ideation process and code development of a full-stack web application using Flask, a powerful yet lightweight Python web framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get started coding, try exploring the Sign Up, Login, and Profile tabs, which walk though the frontend/backend code needed for a full stack application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideation and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideation phase involves defining the application's objectives, designing its architecture, and planning the user experience. Here’s a brief overview of how to approach this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Application Goals**: Determine the primary function of your application. Are you building a user management system, a content management platform, or a data analytics tool? Are you doing a combination of both? Clearly outlining the goals will guide your design and development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Design the User Interface (UI)**: Sketch out the layout and flow of your application. Think about the pages you need, such as a login page, dashboard, or data visualization pages. Define the user interactions and how they will navigate through the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outline the Data Model**: Decide on the data that your application will handle. What information do you need to store? How will you structure your database to manage this data efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Plan the Application Flow**: Map out the interactions between the frontend and backend. Determine how the frontend will communicate with the backend, what API endpoints will be needed, and how data will be exchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a clear ideation plan, it's time to start coding. Here’s an overview of the key steps involved in the code process for a Flask full-stack application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up the Flask Project**:  Generate a template using flask_2025 or flask_portfolio to start your backend repository. Review  the Flask Anatomy/Play tabs, [Python and Flask](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/python%20flask/2023/08/21/python_flask.html) and the READMEs for either flask_2025 and flask_portfolio  to get started with setting up your flask app.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the Backend Logic**: Develop the backend components, including routing, request handling, and database interactions. Define API endpoints for various functionalities, such as user authentication and data retrieval. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Develop the Frontend**: Build the frontend components using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. Create forms, buttons, and other UI elements that will interact with your backend through API calls. We can generate a template using portfolio_2025 to start your frontend repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integrate Frontend and Backend**: Connect the frontend with the backend by making HTTP requests to your API endpoints. Ensure that data flows correctly between the client and server, and handle any necessary data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test and Debug**: Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any issues. Validate that all features work as expected and that the application handles edge cases gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deploy the Application**: Once development is complete and testing is successful, deploy your application. Deploy frontend on Github and backend on AWS (we will use a community server.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can effectively plan and execute a Flask full-stack web application, turning your ideas into a functional and user-friendly product.\n"

    "# What does Full Stack mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into starting our planning, what does building a full stack application  entail?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, when we talk about \"full stack\" in web development, we're referring to the entire set of skills and technologies needed to build a complete web application. Think of it like making a sandwich:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Front-End (The Top Slice of Bread)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This is what users see and interact with. It's the part of the website or app that includes buttons, forms, and other visual elements. Nighthawk coders us tools like HTML, SASS, and JavaScript to create this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back-End (The Filling)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This is the logic that happens behind the scenes. It involves handling the data, and operations of the each request and response. The back-end communicates with the front-end and manages things like storing user data or checking for errors. Nighthawk coders us the Python language and Flask framework for filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database (The Bottom Slice of Bread)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This is where all the information is stored, such as user accounts, messages, or product details. Databases help keep track of this data in an organized way. Nighthawk coders will use SQLAlchemy and SQLite to build and manage the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deployment and DevOps (Putting the Sandwich in a Bag)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Once your sandwich (or web app) is ready, you need to put it in a bag (deploy it) so that people can enjoy it (use it). This involves setting up servers, making sure the app runs smoothly, and updating it as needed. The deployment tab in the navigation bar will be helpful for your backend deployment. For frontend deployment, check out [Tools and Equipment](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/setup) and [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)\n",
    "    \n",
    "So, building a full stack application means creating all parts of the \"sandwich\" so that it’s tasty and functional from top to bottom. You design the user interface, handle the logic and data storage, and make sure everything works together smoothly. "

    "- KASM Server (Does Teacher need to provide the KASM server for the student?) Eg: School chromebooks don't support VSCODE natively)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full-stack user management application, we need a login and sign up system to store username and password, as well as the other attributes listed above. Therefore, we can use the github id as the username, or, as called in the database, uid. Students need to have these attributes to log in.\n",
    "- uid (Github ID)\n",

    "# Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the ideation and planning, let's talk about the <strong> process </strong> of coding the application-the hardest part!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Iterative Coding Process?\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, understanding the iterative coding process is crucial to becoming an effective and efficient developer. Here’s a simple explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Iterative Coding Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative coding process is a way of developing software by breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable parts and working on them in cycles. Instead of trying to build the entire project at once, you work on a small part, meet goals, and then move on to the next goal/part. This cycle repeats until the known project goals are finished. Here's how it works step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan**: Identify a small part of the project to work on. This could be a feature, a function, or a module.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Develop**: Write the code for this small part. Focus on getting it to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test**: Check that the code works as expected. This involves running the code and making sure it does what it’s supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review**: Look at what you’ve done and see if there are any improvements or changes needed. This could be fixing bugs, optimizing the code, or adding more features.  Review includes test and input from another team member.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Move on to the next small part of the project and repeat the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Iterative Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manageable Chunks**: By breaking down the project, you can focus on one thing at a time, which makes it easier to handle.\n",
    "- **Continuous Progress**: You see progress with each iteration, which keeps you motivated.\n",
    "- **Early Detection of Issues**: Since you’re testing and reviewing frequently, you can catch and fix problems early before they become bigger issues.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: You can adjust your goals and make new plans based on what you learn from each iteration. This makes it easier to adapt to changes or new requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you’re building a simple to-do list app. Here’s how you might use the iterative coding process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan**: Decide to start with the feature that lets users add a new to-do item.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Issue**: Make a GitHub issue that describe to-do item in breakdown of development steps of \"Add\", \"Edit\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Develop**: Write the code that creates a new to-do item when the user enters text and clicks an “Add” button.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test**: Run the app and make sure that new to-do items appear in the list correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review**: Check if the code is clean and efficient. Maybe you notice during the work to add the need to add \"Delete\" button to the to-do Issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Move on to adding the \"Edit\" and \"Delete\" buttons as the next small part of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this process, you gradually build the app, making sure each part works well before moving on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative coding process helps beginners stay organized, make steady progress, and learn from each step, making the whole development experience more manageable and less overwhelming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even I used an iterative coding process and talked to Teacher for every step  to build the login, signup, and profile! Check out pull requests for iKAN2025 for portfolio_2025 as an example. As you can see, the new design for the profile is much more streamlined than the old one because I changed and updated the form throughout the coding process."
