    "# Introduction\n",
    "For any web application, the sign-up page is a critical component for developers and users alike. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the process of creating a sign-up page using Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python web framework that is perfect for developing full-stack web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a basic Flask application.\n",
    "- Design and implement a user sign-up form.\n",
    "- Validate form inputs to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- Connect the front-end form to the back-end Flask application.\n",
    "- Store user data securely in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Sign-Up Page\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by setting up the basic UI outline for the sign up form. Then, we'll talk about the database/API in the backend and how they work together. Next, we'll talk about using the frontend API layer to integrate the frontend and backend. Finally, we'll touch on implementing form validation to prevent errors and ensure the data collected is accurate.\n",

As I mentioned in the ideation page, some of the attributes we need are name, github id, password, and the kasm_server_needed attribute (if the user needs a KASM server). When a user submits the form, their  information will be stored in the database. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we walked through the essential steps to create a sign-up page for a Flask full-stack web application. By setting up a Flask environment, designing a user-friendly sign-up form, validating input data, and securely storing user information in a database, we have built a great foundation for user authentication!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap of What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a  Flask application.\n",
    "- Creating a sign-up form using HTML and integrating it with Flask.\n",
    "- Implementing input validation to ensure the integrity of user data.\n",
    "- Connecting the form to the back-end to handle user registration.\n",
    "- Storing user data securely using a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are fundamental to developing a full-stack web application, and mastering them will enable you to build more complex features and applications in the future. As you continue to develop your Flask skills, consider exploring additional topics such as user login, password recovery, and enhancing security measures. (User Login is also a tab on the navbar, check it out!)\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this guide, you now have the knowledge and tools to create a functional and secure sign-up page. Keep experimenting, building, and learning to expand your capabilities as a full-stack developer with Flask.\n",
