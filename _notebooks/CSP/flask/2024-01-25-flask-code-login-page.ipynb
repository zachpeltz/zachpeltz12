    "# Introduction\n",
    "In any web application, the login page is essential for user authentication and access control. In this tutorial, we'll explore the process of creating a login page using Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python web framework that is well-suited for full-stack web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "-  Understand Authentication \n",
    "- Use a Flask application.\n",
    "- Design and implement a user login form.\n",
    "- Validate login credentials to ensure proper authentication.\n",
    "- Connect the front-end login form to the back-end Flask application.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Login Page\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by  talk about what <strong> authentication </strong> means and our basic workflow. Then, we'll set up the basic UI outline for the login form. Then, we'll discuss the backend components, especially the user.py file under the api directory.  Next, we'll integrate the frontend with the backend using API calls. Finally, we'll cover implementing credential validation to ensure correct user authentication.\n",

    "# What is Authentication?\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In web applications, it typically involves checking user credentials (like usernames and passwords) to confirm their identity. Successful authentication allows users to access their accounts and perform actions based on their roles or permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credentials**: Information used to verify identity, such as usernames, passwords, and sometimes additional factors like security questions or biometrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session Management**: Mechanism to keep track of authenticated users and manage their interactions with the web application. Sessions often involve storing session data on the server or using tokens to identify users. (Eg: Logging in on the backend site has a session id created for you)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Token-Based Authentication**: A method where users receive a token (like a JSON Web Token, or JWT) upon successful login. This token is sent with each request to authenticate the user. (We use JWT for handling login with a full stack application.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Password Hashing**: Storing passwords in a secure manner by converting them into a hash using cryptographic algorithms. This ensures that plain-text passwords are not stored in the database (If you check out user.py under the model directory, you'll find the set_password function which generates the hashed password stored in the database)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Workflow of Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Registration**:\n",
    "   - Users create an account by providing necessary information (e.g., username, password).\n",
    "   - Passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Login**:\n",
    "   - Users provide their credentials (e.g., username and password).\n",
    "   - The server verifies the credentials by comparing the hashed password with the stored hash.\n",
    "   - Upon successful authentication, the server creates a session or issues a token for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Session Management**:\n",
    "   - For session-based authentication, a session ID is stored on the server and a cookie is sent to the client.\n",
    "   - For token-based authentication, the token is included in the HTTP headers of each request to authenticate the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Authorization/Access Control**:\n",
    "   - Determine what actions or resources a user can access based on their role or permissions.\n"

    "# Frontend HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "For our frontend, we need a basic outline for our UI. For example, here is the basic HTML login code I created for this site. The attributes we usually see for the login form include username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with the ideation page, the \"username\" corresponds with the `uid` element in the backend, so the request payload should include the `uid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our outline though, the \"uid\" attribute would be hard for users to understand. What does it mean to them? Since the \"uid\" attribute should be the user's GitHub ID, the label should be GitHub ID. That way, users know how to fill in the form correctly.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we covered the essential steps to create a functional login page using Flask. Here's a quick recap of what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Authentication:** We discussed the importance of authentication in web applications and how it ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources.\n",
    "- **Using Flask:** We set up a basic Flask application, highlighting its simplicity and power for building web applications.\n",
    "- **Designing and Implementing a User Login Form:** We created a user-friendly login form using HTML. \n",
    "- **Validating Login Credentials:** We implemented backend logic to validate user credentials, ensuring proper authentication.\n",
    "- **Connecting Frontend to Backend:** We integrated the frontend login form with the backend Flask application using API calls, enabling seamless communication between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this guide, you now have a solid foundation for creating a secure login system in Flask. This knowledge can be extended to implement other authentication features such as registration, password reset, and user roles. With Flask's versatility and your new skills, you're well-equipped for your project!\n",

    "Happy coding!\n"
