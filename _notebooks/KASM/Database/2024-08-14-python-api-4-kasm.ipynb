    "## KASM API Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a guide on how to update a user in KASM using the KASM API. It covers the API endpoint, the required data structure, and the process to follow. Additionally, it highlights the password requirements enforced by KASM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "To update a user in KASM, for instance using Postman, use the following endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "POST /api/public/update_user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Request Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The request to update a user should include the following JSON payload:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"api_key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n",
    "  \"api_key_secret\": \"YOUR_API_KEY_SECRET\",\n",
    "  \"target_user\": {\n",
    "    \"user_id\": \"USER_ID\",\n",
    "    \"username\": \"NEW_USERNAME\",\n",
    "    \"first_name\": \"NEW_FIRST_NAME\",\n",
    "    \"last_name\": \"NEW_LAST_NAME\",\n",
    "    \"locked\": false,\n",
    "    \"disabled\": false,\n",
    "    \"organization\": \"NEW_ORGANIZATION\",\n",
    "    \"phone\": \"123-456-7890\",\n",
    "    \"password\": \"NEW_PASSWORD\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **api_key**: Your KASM API key.\n",
    "- **api_key_secret**: The secret associated with your KASM API key.\n",
    "- **user_id**: Kasm unique identifier of the user to update.\n",
    "- **username**: (Optional) The new username for the user.\n",
    "- **first_name**: (Optional) The new first name of the user.\n",
    "- **last_name**: (Optional) The new last name of the user.\n",
    "- **locked**: (Optional) Boolean value indicating whether the user's account is locked.\n",
    "- **disabled**: (Optional) Boolean value indicating whether the user's account is disabled.\n",
    "- **organization**: (Optional) The new organization or group to which the user belongs.\n",
    "- **phone**: (Optional) The phone number of the user.\n",
    "- **password**: (Optional) The new password for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Password Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "KASM enforces strong password requirements to ensure user account security. The password must meet the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At least 8 characters long\n",
    "- Includes at least one uppercase letter\n",
    "- Includes at least one lowercase letter\n",
    "- Includes at least one number\n",
    "- Includes at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Request\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an update request:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"api_key\": \"example_api_key\",\n",
    "  \"api_key_secret\": \"example_api_key_secret\",\n",
    "  \"target_user\": {\n",
    "    \"user_id\": \"1234\",\n",
    "    \"username\": \"new_username\",\n",
    "    \"first_name\": \"New\",\n",
    "    \"last_name\": \"User\",\n",
    "    \"locked\": false,\n",
    "    \"disabled\": false,\n",

    "    \"password\": \"NewP@ssw0rd\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful request will return a 200 status code along with the updated user details in the response body. If the request fails, the API will return an error message and a corresponding status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user update fails, the KASM API will return an error message. Common reasons for failure include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invalid API credentials**: Ensure that the `api_key` and `api_key_secret` are correct.\n",
    "- **User not found**: The `user_id` provided does not match any existing users.\n",
    "- **Password does not meet requirements**: Ensure that the new password complies with KASM's security policies."

    "## Kasm Python APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers Python code designed to interact with the Kasm API for managing users. The script provides various utilities to authenticate, create, update, and delete Kasm users. It also allows for group management within the Kasm environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The script consists of two main classes:\n",
    "\n",

    "    - Returns: Outputs the server response or an error message if the group change fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kasm Groups and Workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Kasm groups allow you to limit users to specific workspaces, providing a way to control access based on user roles or departments. To assign specific workspaces to a group, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Group**: Navigate to the Kasm administration panel and create a new group.\n",
    "2. **Assign Workspaces**: In the group settings, locate the \"Allowed Workspaces\" section.\n",
    "3. **Select Workspaces**: Choose the specific workspace(s) you want to allow the group members to access.\n",
    "4. **Save Settings**: Apply the settings to limit the group to the selected workspaces.\n",

    "To understand how Kasm reads workspaces from different registries, you can see which workspaces are available in the [Nighthawk Coders Kasm Registry](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/kasm_registry/1.0/). This is the access point for Kasm to pull files from Docker Hub, enabling Kasm to add workspaces through different registries, as explained in the [Kasm Workspace Registry Guide](https://kasmweb.com/docs/latest/guide/workspace_registry.html).\n",
