    "Welcome to your journey of creating your own blogging website! This setup process will guide you through working in a Linux terminal, managing folders, cloning a project, adding packages, and embarking on the `Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)`. This is a fundamental skill for any developer, and while it may seem challenging at first, remember that every expert was once a beginner. Let's dive in and conquer this iconic struggle together!\n",
