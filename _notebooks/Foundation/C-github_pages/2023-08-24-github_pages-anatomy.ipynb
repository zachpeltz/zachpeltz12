    "\n",

    "- `_posts`: This directory contains Markdown (.md) files that will be part of the website. These files are formatted similarly to index.md and include frontmatter (metadata coded in YAML) and Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS source code. You will also find Liquid code in these files, which is used to generate Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.\n",

Files are excluded when they are derived from the original source and not considered part of the project's source code. In the VSCode Explorer, you may notice some files appearing dimmed, indicating that they are purposely excluded by the rules in .gitignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `layouts`: This directory contains HTML files used by Jekyll to generate the structure of the website, including blogs, schedules, and home pages. Each post or notebook specifies a layout in its frontmatter, which determines how the content is presented.\n",
    "\n",
