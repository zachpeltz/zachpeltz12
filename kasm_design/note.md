# Kasm Design Subsection in Portfolio 2025

The Kasm Design subection is a place for all the images and branding to be stored and updated without the background configuration on the Kasm webapp. The `logo/` folder contains all iterations and positions of the Kasm logo, including the `.ico` file. These are then copied to the `current_branding_config` folder, where the names should be:

| Branding Option         | Filename to Name Image |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Favicon                 | favicon.ico            |
| Header Logo             | header.png             |
| Launcher Background     | background.jpg         |
| Login Logo              | loginlogo.png          |
| Login Splash Background | loginbackground.png    |

If these images are not in the right format, they must be converted, as it is critical to the branding configuration. Anytime you want to change an image, you just replace the image while keeping the same filename, and it will update on the Kasm web client.
